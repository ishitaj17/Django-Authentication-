 Django User Authentication Project

This is a Django-based project that implements basic user authentication features such as signup, login, logout, and password reset. 
It uses a custom user model for the project and includes functionality for users to sign up, log in, log out, and reset their passwords.

 Features

- User Authentication: Allows users to sign up, log in, log out, and reset their password.
- Custom User Model: The default Django `User` model is replaced with a custom `CustomUser` model.
- Password Reset: Users can reset their password via email (using Djangoâ€™s built-in password reset functionality).
- Django Views: Implements custom and built-in views like the `LogoutView` and `SignupView`.
- CSRF Protection: CSRF tokens are included in the forms for added security.
